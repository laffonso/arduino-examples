# GPS_ARDUINO
An example of GPS module using NodeMCU and gy-gps6mv2. This project only prints out the latitude, longitude and current time and date.

# MQTTWaterSensor
This project is meant to be a test of how it would be the WiFi radio of a water sensor sending data over MQTT.
You can use this sketch as a starting point for building any sensor to send data over MQTT.

# MQTT_NODEMCU
This sketch is a simple MQTT to UART which receives data via MQTT and sends it to UART. A good starting point to building an actuator WiFi radio

# SmartWasteBin
This is a smart waste bin project which sends the location and weight data over MQTT.

# UARTReceiveExample
A code snipped for receiving data over UART in any Arduino Project

# in-iot-coffeeMachine/in-iot-coffeeMachine
This projects listens to a MQTT topic and take actions depending on the payload publish at the given topic.

# in-iot-juice-machine/in-iot-juice-machine
The same as the in-iot-coffeeMachine/in-iot-coffeeMachine but for juice :)

# tempAndHumiditySensor
This sketch reads a DHT11 sensor and sends the data to In.IoT over MQTT.
